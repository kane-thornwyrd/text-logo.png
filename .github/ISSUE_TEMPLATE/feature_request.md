Extract from the `README.md`:

> I love a well written and pleasant to the eyes `README.md`, thus I adopted [logo.svg](https://github.com/bubkoo/logo.svg), especially when I wrote [Boilerplate](https://github.com/kane-thornwyrd/boilerplate)â€¦
>
> And I have put my hands back on `boilerplate`, after few years, to upgrade everything and fix security issues, and noticed that `logo.svg` is using an old and bugged version of the `dot-prop` library (thanks `npm audit`), and was also quite dormant, with the last commit 6 years ago (and a poor issue filled just to ask why) at the moment I wrote those lines.
>
> So, I have sniffed around a bit in the code of `logo.svg` about its latest version, I didn't even used yet (?). And found out that bubkoo added a call to `update-notifier`, which is fine, I guess, but I prefer simpler pieces of code, without call to a server for a trivial piece of information, however secure and approved that server could be.
>
> So, the corollary to those statements is that this software (text-logo.png) is feature complete, there will **never\*\*** have any other functionalities! (I'll try to be friendly, but asking about adding more features is a de facto questioning about your reading and cognitive capacities)
